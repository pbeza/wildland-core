# supports 12 words long mnemonics; seed is 64 bytes long
# hash seed into 96 bytes of output (sha1024 and discard last 32 bytes?)

# Q: is bip39 crate compatible with ed25519-bip32 crate?
# A: very likely!
# Q: determine how chain_code is generated in ed25519-bip32 crate
# A: in general chain code is: deterministic, from seed, random, and public
#    bip32 uses hmacsha512 with domain separator
