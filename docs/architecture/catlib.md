# Catlib

## Definition

Catlib (also referred to as catalog backend) is a decentralized database that
serves as synchronization endpoint for multiple devices. Synchronized data is
not private, and nothing security-sensitive should be stored here.

## Catlib Storage

Currently stored in catlib are:

* Forest (pubkey identity, full forest manifest)
* Containers
* Bridges (shared containers)

## API

Catlib does not expose any api to the public, nor can be currently created from
the outside as an instance.
