## Documentation structure

### Architecture

* path: `docs/architecture`
* purpose: information about each component, schema registry, object builder,
  and other applications. It contains only our internal architecture description,
  the current state of each element. Information what it does, why and how, what
  algorithms (from a broad perspective without many implementation details) were
  used, the protocol between the systems, etc. It should be enough information
  to adapt a new developer to the project quickly.
* used by: Dev Team

### Configuration

* path: `docs/configuration`
* purpose: description of all ENV variables and configuration files
* used by: Deployment/User

### Deployment

* path: `docs/deployment`
* purpose: documentation of how to deploy the project or its artifacts
* used by: Deployment/User

### Examples

* path: `docs/examples`
* purpose: a place for tutorials, code examples and guides.
* used by: Developer/User

### Features

* path: `docs/features`
* purpose: a place for feature (behavior) description. Each feature should have
  at least one document describing it. Example: file_ordering.md,
  partial_delta_synchronization.md
* used by: Developer/User/Management

### Processes

* path: `docs/processes`
* purpose: a place for all our processes. For example: commit message
  formalization of this process.
* used by: Dev Team

### RFCs

* path: `docs/rfc`
* purpose: a place for all RFCs.
* used by: Dev Team

## RFC process

RFC describes only **change** to the project. The change might be:

* New feature
* Modification of existing feature
* New process
* Modification of existing process
* Documentation about research done

It does not contain information about a single component (its current state,
as this is the purpose of `architecture`).

### RFC Category

Each RFC must contain a category informing whether it describes the feature,
process or the research. Accepted values: `Feature`/`Process`/`Research`.

### RFC Deadline

Each RFC must contain a deadline to speed up the process. Before the deadline
is met, the author should remind all interested parties about it.

If the deadline is met without conclusion, the author of the RFC should create
a meeting and invite all interested in these RFC parties. Then during this
meeting resolution has to be made.

The deadline must be set at least 3 days from the announcement. RFC author
should schedule the meeting on the nearest possible date that is acceptable for
all parties.

Until the deadline, everyone is allowed to comment on the RFC. Participants
should use the scheduled meeting only to decide when there is more than one
strong opinion about the subject. All issues should be defined and discussed
via the comments on git hosting site. The deadline meeting should be relatively
short if every participant agrees on the subject.

There may be exceptions to this rule - for example, when during a deadline
meeting, everyone agrees to wait for new information from superiors, etc.

### RFC ordering number

Each RFC has an assigned ordering number that is an always-increasing integer.
In rare situations, there might be gaps between two integers.
RFC ordering number is encoded by a 4-digit (fixed length) decimal integer (values
from `0001` to `9999`). In the future, it might be extended by prefixing
additional zeroes (`9999` becomes `09999`).

* RFC ordering number has to be unique.
* RFC ordering number and feature ID are not the same concepts.

### The process

#### Draft

The author of the RFC should create a new document in the `rfc` directory.
This directory has a flat structure, and each RFC should have a filename in
human-readable format with RFC ordering prefix number and version postfix number.
For example: `1234_database_scheme.md`.

Format:
`<RFC ordering number>_<Human readable name>.md`

Each RFC should contain at least the following sections in the format:

* "Motivation" - explaining the reasoning behind the rfc (what does the rfc
  solves or why was it brought to the table)
* "Impact Analysis" - containing, if applies:
  * work, packages, and tasks needed to implement RFC, rough estimates are also
    welcome,
  * breakage of contracts or features if any,
  * any other action that is required to properly implement the RFC,

RFC Header Example:

````text
# Front Matter

```
Title           : Schema-Registry-less deployment
Category        : Feature
Author(s)       : Yours Trully
Team            : Corex Team
Created         : 2021-06-24
Deadline        : 2021-06-26
Feature ID      : FEAT-00016-00
```
````

* Feature ID is only required for feature descriptions. If the RFC describes
  a process, this field should be omitted.
* Team field is optional.
* RFC format allows other custom fields to be included if necessary, such as why
  RFC has been abandoned.
* The author should commit the draft to a separate branch, for example,
  `user/rfc/<filename>`.

#### Pull Request

When the draft is ready for review, an author should create PR and inform
reviewers.

#### Resolution

Each RFC must result in:

* When accepted:
  * If the team decides to implement a feature described in the RFC:
    * Implementor should create tracking issue - he should include its id
  * in `features/index.md` table.
    * Update in `architecture` - all components that were changed should be
      updated, so this RFC won't be needed to understand how, for example,
      Object Builder works. It should be done as a  part of PR that has been
      merged.
    * Update in `features` - if RFCs category is `Feature` - Update existing or
      create new feature.md and write a new description of what this feature
      does. In some cases, the author can selectively copy-paste it from RFC;
      however, the author must be careful. It should be done as a part of PR
      that has been merged.
  * If RFC describes the process:
    * `processes/index.md` needs to be updated
    * Update in `processes` - if RFCs category is `Process` - Update existing
      or create a new process.md and write a further description of how the
      process looks. In some cases, the author can selectively copy-paste it
      from RFC; however, the author must be careful. Implementor should do
      it in PR that has been merged.
* If the deadline has been met, but no conclusion has been reached - RFC should
  be updated with the new deadline (sub-issues).
* When abandoned - RFC should be updated with `Abandon reason` in
  Front Matter (top of the document).

It also means PRs with implementations should not be accepted and merged before
merging documentation.

Exception: It is allowed to split PR into smaller, by merging the first and
then separate PR documentation. However, until the last PR implementation is
merged, **tracking issue has to be kept open**.

#### Further changes

Apart from minor typo fixes, and formatting, RFC is immutable. Whenever there
is a need to change the feature or the process, one should create another RFC
describing new goals and changes.

### Summary

RFC describes **changes** while `features`/`processes`/`architecture` keep
up-to-date information about the current state of the project.
