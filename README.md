## Catlib backend

Running Wildland Core requires Redis server to be accessible from local or remote network. The
server must be accessible at all times even if one does not interact with Catalog backend.

The default connection string is `redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0` where `/0` denotes database with id `0`.
The default connection string can be overriden by specifying it in a `CARGO_REDIS_URL` environment
variable.

_note: this solution is temporary and will be shortly replaced by a cargo configuration entry_

## Local Documentation

To build the documentation locally, the cargo tool and some dependencies are required.

- install dependencies:
  `cargo install mdbook mdbook-mermaid mdbook-plantuml mdbook-toc mdbook-linkcheck mdbook-graphviz mdbook-katex`
- setup dependency config
  `mdbook-mermaid install .`
- generate and open the documentation
  `mdbook build --open`

## Logging

Logging works over tracing::subscriber and is only configurable via a client
application. Please refer to the logging and configuration documentation.
Environment variables will not work.

### WASM

A WASM example project can be found in [this [directory](./tests/ffi/wasm/) and its README file is located [here](./tests/ffi/wasm/README.md).
